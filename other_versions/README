This Patcher.bat is for RCA Voyager tablet with intel soc

It is intended to be used to root this device.
The RCA Voyager has many different builds, most to all of them with different hardware.
I have built this around my own build number.
RCT6873W42-ANDROID6.0-V19-V1.16.50-E04

I expect it would work on most RCT6873W42 builds. 
If you are only utilizing the "boot" functions to test, It "should" be safe to try with other builds.


The batch "tool" does the following

1. Performs the commands needed to unlock bootlader. (you need to make sure your drivers are installed)

2. Boots to cwm to get root shell. (cwm might not display screen for you but it supposed to have active ADBD)

3. The batch downloads boot.img and recovery.img from device while in the booted cwm.

4. Interactive menus walk you through unpacking and Patching the images.
   unpacking utilizes carlivs android image kitchen scripts
