1. enable developer options on tablet. 
	open settings, click on about device, tap "build number" 7-10 times. 

2.	Go back to settings page.There is new option "Developer option"
	open developer options and make sure "oem unlock" is checked and
	"adb debugging" is checked.
3. when usb cable is connected you should now get a pop up window on tablet asking permission to connect to pc
	allow the connection
	
4. Adb and fastboot installed on pc. 
	
5. Drivers for intel device.
	Adb driver for me has always installed automaticly. But Fastboot driver has needed to updated manually.
	I usually just go into command promt "adb reboot fastboot" .
	The Tab will reboot with an apparent blank screen, if you look closely you will note that there is a faint backlight. 
	Once in this mode your PC will have a new device in device manager, and you may have a repeated connect / disconnect sound.
	You can do an Update driver select Browse my computer for driver software, 
	then Let me pick from a List of device drivers on my computer, 
	then scroll down to the Intel Android Device in the list and select 
	either the Intel Android Bootloader device or the Android Bootloader Device, Both seem to work fine.
 
  **in the following steps if a file is mentioned in an adb line or fastboot line then file location needs to be amended to the command.***
  
 A:  UNLOCK BOOT LOADER
 
    1: Open cmd promtp type "adb reboot fastboot"
	2: Verify connected to fastboot by typing "fastboot devices"
	3: If connection verified type "fastboot flashing unlock"
	4: tablet screen should have message to confirm unlock by pressing volume button
	5: reboot tablet "fastboot reboot"
	6: factory recovery should boot and complete the unlock by doing a factory reset
	7: after bootloader is unlocked everytime you boot there will be a message complaining 
	   about device is now untrusted, let the 30 second timer count down
	   
 B:	 FLASH A MODIFIED PERMISSIVE BOOT.IMG
   **Modified boot.img changes tablet from force-encrition of /data to  encriptable /data (needed to simplify un-bricking)**	
	
	
	1: open cmd prompt type "adb reboot fastboot"
	2: type "fastboot flash boot rca-boot_permissive-20170316-1706.img"
	*** /data now needs to be formated again to remove encryption
	3: type "fastboot format userdata"
	4: type "fastboot format cache"
	5: reboot type "fastboot reboot"
	
 C:   FLASH A MODIFIED "STOCK" RECOVERY (it has adb enabled for use as emergency acces into fastboot if needed)
	***also need to flash modified "stock" recovery because if not and enter recovery after /data is decripted then it will get encripted again 
	
	1: open cmd prompt type "adb reboot fastboot"
	2: type "fastboot flash recovery rca-recovery-adb-NO-ENCRYPT.img"
	3: reboot type "fastboot reboot"
	
 D:	  BOOT INTO CWM RECOVERY TO MAKE BACKUP AND FLASH SUPERSU
      ****DO NOT FLASH THIS RECOVERY------ ONLY BOOT IT*********
	  
	  
	  1: open cmd prompt type "adb reboot fastboot"
	  2: type "fastboot boot rca-recovery-cwm-ramdisk.img"
	  3: once loaded recomend to make a backup.
	  4: need to remount device in order to install superSU in cmd type "adb remount" (recovery is still not 100% correct)
	  5: in cmd type "adb push UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.79-SYSTEMMODE.zip /sdcard/0/Download/"
	  6: then use CWM screens to navigate to the superSu.zip and install
