Four steps to root RCA Voyager RCT6873W42

**THERE ARE THREE BUILD VERSIONS V19, V21, and V31**
**With prebuilt images.**

  New method of pulling images off your own device and patching them is described at the bottom or page.
  Also new batch file "tool" was created to make process easier.
  Patching is made possible by including "CARLIV android kitchen" script inside this tool.


Pre-requirement for manually installing prebuilt files.

1. enable developer options on tablet. 
	open settings, click on about device, tap "build number" 7-10 times. 

2.	Go back to settings page.There is new option "Developer option"
	open developer options and make sure "oem unlock" is checked and
	"adb debugging" is checked.
3. when usb cable is connected you should now get a pop up window on tablet asking permission to connect to pc
	allow the connection
	
4. Adb and fastboot installed on pc. 
	
5. Drivers for intel device.
	Adb driver for me has always installed automaticly. But Fastboot driver has needed to updated manually.
	I usually just go into command promt "adb reboot fastboot" .
	The Tab will reboot with an apparent blank screen, if you look closely you will note that there is a faint backlight. 
	Once in this mode your PC will have a new device in device manager, and you may have a repeated connect / disconnect sound.
	You can do an Update driver select Browse my computer for driver software, 
	then Let me pick from a List of device drivers on my computer, 
	then scroll down to the Intel Android Device in the list and select 
	either the Intel Android Bootloader device or the Android Bootloader Device, Both seem to work fine.
 
  **in the following steps when a file is mentioned in an adb line or fastboot line then file location needs to be amended to the command.***
  
 A:  UNLOCK BOOT LOADER
 
    1: Open cmd promtp type "adb reboot fastboot"
	2: Verify connected to fastboot by typing "fastboot devices"
	3: If connection verified type "fastboot flashing unlock"
	4: tablet screen should have message to confirm unlock by pressing volume button
	5: reboot tablet "fastboot reboot"
	6: factory recovery should boot and complete the unlock by doing a factory reset
	7: after bootloader is unlocked everytime you boot there will be a message complaining 
	   about device is now untrusted, let the 30 second timer count down

 B:   FLASH A MODIFIED "STOCK" RECOVERY (it has adb enabled for use as emergency acces into fastboot if needed)
	***also need to flash modified "stock" recovery because if not and enter recovery after /data is decripted then it will get encripted again 
	
	1: open cmd prompt type "adb reboot fastboot"
   *v19 2: type "fastboot flash recovery rca-recovery-adb-NO-ENCRYPT.img"
   *v31 2: type "fastboot flash recovery w31-recovery-20170719-1816.img"
   *v21 2: type "fastboot flash recovery voyager-V21-modified-stock-recovery.img"
    3: reboot type "fastboot reboot"
	4: reboot to recovey, make sure adb is working there. Either by adb command "adb reboot recovery" or button combo	

 C:	 FLASH A MODIFIED PERMISSIVE BOOT.IMG
   **Modified boot.img changes tablet from force-encrition of /data to  encriptable /data (needed to simplify un-bricking)**	
	***Do a test boot of boot.img before flashing***
   Doing step 2-a will test if tablet boots with the supplied image(an error message about encryption is expected) it may suggest doing a factory reset to fix. As this was just a test do not do that factory reset.

	
	1: open cmd prompt type "adb reboot fastboot"
     v19   2-a: type "fastboot boot rca-boot_permissive-20170316-1706.img"
     v31   2-a: type "fastboot boot v31-test-rca-boot_permissive-20170709-2048.img"
     v21   2-a: type "fastboot boot rca-voyager-V21-boot.img"															 
     ****If tablet booted it could be OK to do 2-b
      *****If did not boot then hold power button to turn off then back on
     
*** If test boot was OK start over at #1 and continue to 2-b
     v19   2-b: type "fastboot flash boot rca-boot_permissive-20170316-1706.img"
	 v31   2-b: type "fastboot flash boot v31-test-rca-boot_permissive-20170709-2048.img"
	 v21   2-a: type "fastboot flash boot rca-voyager-V21-boot.img"																
	 *** /data now needs to be formated again to remove encryption
	3: type "fastboot format userdata"
	4: type "fastboot format cache"
	5: reboot type "fastboot reboot"
	
 D:	  BOOT INTO CWM RECOVERY TO MAKE BACKUP AND FLASH SUPERSU
      ****DO NOT FLASH THIS RECOVERY------ ONLY BOOT IT*********
	  
	  
	  1: open cmd prompt type "adb reboot fastboot"
	  v19 2: type "fastboot boot rca-recovery-cwm-ramdisk.img"
	  v31 2: type "fastboot boot v31-test-rca-recovery-cwm-ramdisk-20170709-2052.img"
	  v21 2: type "fastboot boot rca-voyager-V21-CWM-recovery.img"															   
	  3: once loaded recomend to make a backup.
	  4: need to remount device in order to install superSU in cmd type "adb remount" (recovery is still not 100% correct)
	  5: in cmd type "adb push UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.79-SYSTEMMODE.zip /sdcard/0/Download/"  
	  6: then use CWM screens to navigate to the superSu.zip and install

IF YOUR BUILD NUMBER IS NOT ONE OF THE ONES WITH PREBUILT FILES, YOU MIGHT STILL BE ABLE TO USE THE CLOCKWORK RECOVERY TO PULL STOCK IMAGES
TO BE USD TO MAKE A WORKING ROOT ON THE BUILD VERSION YOU HAVE.

	  In this case follow these steps to get a root adb shell to pull stock images.
	  
	Pre-requirement.
Need micro Sd card to copy files to.

 B:   Boot CWM RECOVERY
      ****DO NOT FLASH THIS RECOVERY------ ONLY BOOT IT*********
	  ****SCREEN IS NOT EXPECTED TO SHOW RECOVERY--BLANK SCREEN IS EXPECTED***
	  
	  1: open cmd prompt type "adb reboot fastboot"
	  2: type "fastboot boot rca-recovery-cwm-ramdisk.img"
	  3: adb shell mount external_sd
      4: adb shell mkdir /external_sd/RCA
      5: adb shell dd if=/dev/block/platform/soc0/e0000000.noc/by-name/ImcPartID071 of=/external_sd/RCA/mmcblk0p9-boot.img
	  6: adb shell dd if=/dev/block/platform/soc0/e0000000.noc/by-name/ImcPartID121 of=/external_sd/RCA/mmcblk0p10-recovery.img
	  7: adb pull external_sd/RCA %userprofile%\downloads
	  8: Use carliv to unpack your stock recovery and boot images
	  9: Add downloaded V19 images to carliv resourse folders (recovery to recovery resource, boot to boot resource)
	  10: Unpack all images
	  11: Copy "recovery.img-kernel" and "recovery.img-second" from your stock recovery folder to the unpacked CWM folder.
	  12: repack CWM
	  13: copy "/ramdisk/sbin/adbd" from v19 boot folder to your boot folder
	  14: copy "/ramdisk/sepolicy" from v19 boot folder to your boot folder
	  15: copy "/ramdisk/init.rc" from v19 boot folder to your boot folder
	  16: copy "/ramdisk/default.prop" from v19 boot folder to your boot folder
	  17: copy "/ramdisk/fstab.sofiaboard_emmc" from v19 boot folder to your boot folder
	  18: copy "/ramdisk/fstab.sofiaboard_nand" from v19 boot folder to your boot folder
	  19: repack your boot.img
	  20: Stock recovery edit /ramdisk/default.prop with following changes
	  a. "ro.secure=1" change to "ro.secure=0"
	  b. "ro.debuggable=0" change to "ro.debuggable=1"
	  c. "persist.sys.usb.config=none" change to "persist.sys.usb.config=mtp,adb"
	       ADD these lines
		 persist.service.adb.enable=1                                                    
		 persist.service.debuggable=1
	  21: repack stock recovery.

Test boot your new boot.img 
Test boot the cwm recovery.
Flash the modified stock recovery and test if adb works.

If these steps work follow the directions from above useing your new img files.

Using the new patch tool, the results are cleaner. Your boot.img build date, 
and signature line do not get changed. Using this manual method listed above 
might cause trouble , with just swapping init.rc and default.prop from different 
device.
