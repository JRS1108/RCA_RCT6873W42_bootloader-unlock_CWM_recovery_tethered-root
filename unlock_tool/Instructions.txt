**To use the tool Device must be connected with adb debugging enabled

**After bootloader unlock device MUST be formated. 
  DO NOT try to bypass this step

**After flashing no-encrypt images device MUST be formated also

**Both FACTORY boot.img and recovery.img have "forceencrypt" flag set
  this is why they need to be changed. 
  BOTH boot and recovery need to be changed together. Cannot do only one.
  After replaceing boot.img data partition need to be formated.

First thing you must have adb and fastboot installed.
  Easiest method to install adb + fastboot on windows is with "15 second adb + fastboot install TOOL"

Second you need drivers for Intel android usb

Adb driver for me has always installed automaticly. But Fastboot driver has needed to updated manually.
I usually just go into command promt "adb reboot fastboot" .
The Tab will reboot with an apparent blank screen, if you look closely you will note that there is a faint backlight. 
Once in this mode your PC will have a new device in device manager, and you may have a repeated connect / disconnect sound.
You can do an Update driver select Browse my computer for driver software, 
then Let me pick from a List of device drivers on my computer, 
then scroll down to the Intel Android Device in the list and select 
either the Intel Android Bootloader device or the Android Bootloader Device, Both seem to work fine.





Follow steps in order. 1-3, 
steps 4 is to boot into recovery mode.
step 5 is obsolete now that superSU can be installed
step 6 brings you back here to these instructions
step 7 Pushes the superSU.zip install .zip to Download folder, then boots into CWM recovery and tells you steps to install it
       there is a command to automate this but there is a bug ritght now, so it must be manually done.
