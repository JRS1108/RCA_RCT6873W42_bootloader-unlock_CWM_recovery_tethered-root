This is for tracking changes to boot image and recovery for the RCA Voyager. Model RCT6873W42.

I started with borrowed CWM recovery from Vampirefo, then with that recovery (it did not boot with all mounts or even a screen, but it provided a working root shell)

I then used that rot shell to pull the stock boot and recovery images. 

After making some changes to the fstab's in both recovery and boot, Now CWM now boots from fastboot boot, unfortunatly it still does not run if flashed inside tablet.
